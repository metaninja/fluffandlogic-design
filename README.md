# Fluff and Logic: The Perpetual Penultimate Version

## New beginnings.
- Ditched the Design Thinking approach. It wasn't working. And it wasn't me.
- Went from PHP to Angular to Vue.js.
- Finally updated a lot of the missing content.

Still a long way to go but much further ahead than I was 2 months ago.
