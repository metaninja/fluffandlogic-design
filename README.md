# Fluff and Logic Redesign v2.0 (Alpha)
Complete overhaul of Fluff and Logic using Design Thinking as the core of the site. 
As with the previous version of the Fluff and Logic redesign, the goal is continued down the path of focusing
not on selling myself, but trying to connect with what issues potential employees / clients might be having, and
helping them solve them.

In addition, I'm using a more Product Design (instead of Graphics Design) focused approach to the website, including using tools like **Lean Business Canvas[https://medium.com/@steve_mullen/an-introduction-to-lean-canvas-5c17c469d3e0]**, **Value Proposition Canvas[https://strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas]**, and trying to understand the **Product (me) -> Market (potential employer)** fit.

## This is an alpha version
A lot of pieces are still missing, including:
- Illustrations, especially on the homepage
- Additional per page design
- Custom fonts (body font was supposed to be Avenir, but that wasn't available at the time)
- Refining the existing styling for certain components like the Next Page button at the bottom of the screen.
