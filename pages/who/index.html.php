        Hello.
    </h2>

    <p class="intro center">My name is Sherif Tariq. For the last two decades, I’ve been thinking about and experimenting with
    interaction design and user experience design.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>



    <p>
        I’ve worked in companies of all sizes, from small studios with a few people, to multinational enteprise
        companies with tens of thousands of employees and managers all over the world.
     </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        I’ve worked in Telecommunications
         companies, both hardware and software, a civil engineering company, a digital signage company and an insurance
         software company. I’ve consulted with companies in the field of financial services, print and publishing,
         prison security, secure web hosting, and events management.

        I love solving big, challenging, problems.

    <p>
        I love user research. User research is all above uncovering the unknown unknowns, the facts about the project
        that even the subject matter experts aren’t aware of. I love usability testing. There’s nothing more thrilling
        than having my theories be proven wrong, because it opens up pathways and possibilities I would never have
        dreamed of otherwise.

    <p>
        I love ideation. I built <a href="http://bff.how/" target="_blank">BFF</a> to help design teams ideate faster without the limits of
                traditional design teams.
