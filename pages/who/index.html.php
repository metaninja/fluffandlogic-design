                Hi. My name is Sherif Tariq. For the last two decades, I've been thinking about and experimenting with interaction
                design and user experience design.

            <p>I've worked in companies of all sizes, from small studios with a few people, to
                multinational enteprise companies with tens of thousands of employees and managers all over the world.</p>

            <p>
                I've worked in Telecommunications companies, both hardware and software, a civil engineering company, a digital
                signage company and an insurance software company. I've consulted with companies in the field of financial services,
                print and publishing, prison security, secure web hosting, and events management.
            </p>


            <p>I love solving big, challenging, problems. </p>

            <p>I love user research. User research is all above uncovering the unknown unknowns, the facts about the project that
            even the subject matter experts aren't aware of. I love usability testing. There's nothing more thrilling than having
            my theories be proven wrong, because it opens up pathways and possibilities I would never have dreamed of otherwise.</p>

            <p>I love ideation. I built <a href="http://bff.how">BFF</a> to help design teams ideate faster without the limits of traditional design teams.</p>


            <p>How can I help you?</p>
