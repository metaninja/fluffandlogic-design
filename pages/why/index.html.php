            Why Design<br> Thinking?

        <h3>It’s not the user’s job to come up with a solution</h3>
        <p>
            The problem with the traditional SDLC process is that it asks the user to tell the company what to
            build. That’s not the user’s job! In addition, there’s been a lot of research over the decades and
            what we found out is, what users say vs what they do are two completely different things. Users can
            explain the symptoms of the problem, but they very rarely have the framework to suggest a solution.

        <h3>
            Developing a solution to a problem requires time
        </h3>
        <p>
            Unless I’m a product designer working on the exact same problem that I’m trying to solve, and I’m
            incredibly passionate and focused on that exact problem, it takes time and structured thinking to
            figure out the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond that, asking users for a solution only surfaces the symptom of the problem. It’s up to us,
            as product managers, designers, researchers, and developers to dig into the symptoms and research
            the cause, and then develop a solution.

        <h3>Solving problems requires people from different backgrounds</h3>
        <p>The cellphone. User interface. Computers. Software. UI frameworks. Computing in the cloud. All of these
            technological innovations were solutions to problems that took teams of people with different
            backgrounds to come together and iterate until they developed a viable solution.</p>

        <h2>Saving Time With Design Thinking</h2>

        <p>
            Thankfully, most of the problems we deal with won’t take decades and hundreds or thousands of people to
            solve. Often times, we can solve it in weeks using a small team of 4-8 people. It just takes user research,
            and a structured, methodical approach to the problem.
