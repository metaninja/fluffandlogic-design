    <h1>What is Design Thinking?</h1>
    <p>
        Design thinking is an approach to problem solving that starts by gathering user data, bringing together a team and
        then methodically defining the problem, interating on a solution, and validating that solution with real users.

    <h3>Traditionally, enterprise companies approach to product design used the following approach:</h3>

    <ol class="page-steps">
        <li>
            <object class="placeholder-icon"></object>
            Ask the customer what features they want.
        </li>
        <li>
            <object class="placeholder-icon"></object>
            Pass the customer request to a business analyst who then writes up the requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <object class="placeholder-icon"></object>
            Hand the requirements to the developers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <object class="placeholder-icon"></object>
            Wait 6-9 months (usually longer) to deliver a beta product.
        </li>
        <li>
            <object class="placeholder-icon"></object>
            Go through weeks of QA testing and minor bug fixes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <object class="placeholder-icon"></object>
            Go to production.
        </li>
        <li>
            <object class="placeholder-icon"></object>
            When customers inevitably find problems with the product, hire support people to surface the source of the problem and bring it to the developers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <object class="placeholder-icon"></object>
            Repeat step 1.
        </li>

    </ol>


    <h3>The problem with this approach is that we’re assuming the customer always knows what they want.</h3>

    <div class="two-col">
        <p>
            What we’ve found from user interviews and extensive user testing is that, users can only tell us what they <em>think</em> the problem is;
            if we stop there and develop a solution based on that conversation, it's like putting a band aid on an infection. You've temporarily healed
            some of the symptoms, but the source of the problem is still there, and continues to grow.
        </p>

    <h3>Enter Design Thinking</h3>

    <p>
        To understand the real problem, we have to dig deeper. We have to listen to the user to understand what their pain points are,
        develop a hypothesis that we can build into a solution, and then measure the user's response using usability testing and analytics
        to validate and iterate on that solution.
