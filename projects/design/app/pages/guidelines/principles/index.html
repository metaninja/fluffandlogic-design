                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <p>As a team we want to develop a <strong>consistent</strong> user interface when developing the EZLynx app.
                        A consistent user interface is not only good for the user, it also helps us get features to our customers faster.</p>

                    <h4>Good For The User</h4>

                    <p>For the user, even if an experience is less than ideal,
                        once they learn how to use it, they can reuse that knowledge elsewhere in the app.
                        A consistent experience gives the appearance of a polished robust app, which helps with
                        branding and marketing.
                    </p>


                    <h4>Good For Development</h4>

                    <p>For development, consistency saves time by allowing us to reuse existing styles and features,
                        which means more time working on features, and less time tweaking structural and presentation code,
                        which makes development more manageable over the long term.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tl:dr;</strong> Spend less time writing HTML code, more time working on the functionality.</p>


                    <h3>Why Guiding Principles?</h3>

                    <p>Guiding principles help unite Product, Development with a common, shared goal that we can all aspire to.
                        They help us figure out what to prioritize when designing the UI for the app.
                    </p>

                            <h3>Start With Workflows and Mental Models</h3>
                            <p>At EZLynx,<a href="https://app.uxpin.com/dashboard/projects" target="_blank">UXPin</a> is our preferred tool for ideating or designing UIs.
                                UXPin makes it very easy to jump right in and come up with a solution for a customer feature or problem. Too easy, in fact.</p>
                            <p>The problem is, if we don't spend some
                                time up front thinking about what we're going to build, we can easily end up solving the wrong problem,
                                or solving the problem wrong, which increases support calls and might mean additional development time to fix the problem we
                                initially set out to solve.</p>

                            <p>Before you jump into UXPin, spend some time sketching out the user/process/work flow on a whiteboard.
                                Where will the user start to get to your feature? What steps will they follow to get there? What is the first thing they need to do?</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Test With Users Before Development</h3>
                            <p>Development is expensive. Once a team has started developing a feature, it's highly unlikely we'll be able to make major changes.</p>
                            <p>With that in mind, once your mockups and prototypes look good enough for development, give some users a call, and let them test drive your
                                features in UXPin or via our <a href="http://design.webcetera.com/prototype" target="_blank">prototype</a>, and give you feedback.
                                You only need 3-5 users to solve nearly 85% of the user issues that crop up with most new features.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Favor Reuse And Consistency Over Innovation</h3>

                            <p>When creating a new feature, try to use the existing building blocks (colors, styles, and components) as much as possible.
                                Only if the existing standards aren't adequate, or if it will result in a worse user experience,
                                should you think about creating innovative new UIs that use controls or colors not already available in the app.</p>

                            <p>For instance, do we already have a file uploader in the system? Yes, we do. In fact we have <strong>FIVE</strong>.
                            When working with development, look for ways to reuse features we've built or used elsewhere in the system.</p>

                            <h3>Strive For Clarity Over Brevity</h3>
                            <p>Whenever possible, be very clear about what action you're about to perform.<br>
                                E.g. Labeling a button <strong>"Clear Login"</strong> instead of <strong>"Login"</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Note that the button should be <strong><em>concise</em></strong> and <strong><em>not verbose</em></strong>.<br>
                                e.g. <strong>"Clear Login"</strong> instead of <strong>"Please Click Here To Clear Your Login"</strong>.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Use Icons Instead of Images</h3>
                            <p>The EZLynx app ships with a <strong><a href="#/app/pages/icons/index.html">large set of icons</a></strong>.<br>
                                With a few rare exceptions (e.g. the icons in the Applicant Overview sidebar) in the app,
                                use icons instead of bitmap graphics like PNGs.</p>
                        </li>
