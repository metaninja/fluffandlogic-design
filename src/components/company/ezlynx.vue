            <p>
                Fifteen years ago, EZLynx rocked the independent insurance industry by developing Rating Engine, a tool that
                let independent insurance agencies get several quotes from insurance companies in seconds instead of laboriously
                entering a customers details over and over again on each insurance company's website. Since then, EZlynx has
                added other features to help an agency run it's entire digital operation, from sales and marketing to support
                and re-marketing (researching better rates for a customer before renewal time).
