            Securusâ€™s Secure Communication Platform (SCP) is used by prisons to monitor inmate communications with the
            outside world and to analyze the conversations for potentially criminal activity. By the time Slalom had been
            hired to update the software, it was 8 years old and showing its age. Performance was atrociously slow. A single
            search could take upwards of 5-8 minutes to return results.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user interface was extremely complicated and confusing. The interface had designed by developers and had
            grown organically over the years as new features were added without any thought to information architecture.

              I joined the UX team after they had completed the discovery phase and started development. The team was
              struggling with the tools they were using and was starting to fall behind the development efforts. The team
              had started prototyping in Axure, but by this time, they had switched to prototyping in code. To speed up the
              efforts, I helped research a variety of different prototyping tools, but all of them had problems.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, with the team falling further behind, I developed my own prototyping tool, called BFF (Barebones
              Functional Framework), a collection of development libraries and tools tied together by a custom stripped down
              JavaScript framework that I had developed to help the UX team quickly prototype in code without the steep
              learning curve of traditional JavaScript frameworks like Angular JS.
            </p>

            <p>
              By prototyping in code, we were able to continuously build on top of the existing code and create reusable
              components that could grow with the team. A month or so in, the rest of the UX team left the prototyping to me
              so they could focus on managing the client stakeholders and the 2-3 agile teams working on the project out of
              multiple locations.
            </p>

            <p>
              As part of the prototyping effort, I developed a set of design guidelines that the app would follow. A few
              months in, my UX manager developed a new identity for Securus. I helped roll out the new styles across the
              prototype. I also jumped into front-end development periodically to ensure the development environment was in
              sync with the prototype.

            <p>
              About a year in, we had enough functionality to be able to do usability testing. By then a new colleague had
              joined the UX team. I helped write the usability testing script with him, and traveled to three separate
              facilities (including one inside an actual prison) to get user feedback and tweak the design accordingly.

            <p>
              Securus wanted to roll out their new identity and the design we had created for SCP to the rest of the
              company. Based on our experience working with multiple geographically distributed agile teams, we began to
              worry about how to ensure consistency across all the applications. We had recently seen a presentation by Gina
              at SalesForce about how SalesForce had used a design system to ensure consistency and speed development across
              their organization.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that in mind, I worked with my UX colleagues to build a set of guidelines and reusable components that
              Securus developers could use to ensure consistency with the new identity and the design guidelines we had
              established for Securus.
