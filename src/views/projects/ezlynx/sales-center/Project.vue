            <p>
              Sales is the lifeblood of an independent insurance agency. For an agency to survive and grow, agents have to
              keep track of prospects (potential customers) at various stages of the sales process and make sure customers
              keep them in mind long after they’ve purchased an insurance policy.
            </p>

            <p>
              EZLynx developed Sales Center to expand into the sales aspect agency management. The initial release of Sales
              Center had a lot of usability issues. The interface was dense with information. There was no hierarchy to the
              information. The user was expected to take each sales prospect through a series of steps but it wasn’t obvious
              from the interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              The poor user experience resulted in numerous customers cancelling their Sales Center paid plans after a couple
              of months of use. The exec team realized that a drastic overhaul was necessary.

          <h3 class="page-details-title">Discovery</h3>
          <div class="page-details-desc">
            <p>I knew little about the sales process in general. I interviewed a colleague who had been a sales agent in a
              previous job so I could better understand the sales process. Based on recommendation I did some research into
              tools such as Pipedrive , Trello, and Jira to understand.

        <section class="page-details">
          <h3 class="page-details-title">Ideation</h3>
          <div class="page-details-desc">
            <p>Based on my research, I updated the Sales Center interface to resemble a pipeline, so it was apparent to users
              that they had to move each sales opportunity from one stage to the next to close the sales. For each stage of
              the pipeline, I added a summary of the total estimated premium at that stage, to encourage sales people to move
              the opportunity forward. In addition, I switched the view from a table to a card view. Each card had just enough
              information for a user to quickly contact a prospect. Users could then drag and drop the card to the next stage.
              The card view gave users a birds eye view of all their opportunities to help them prioritize who to call next.
            </p>

            <p>I moved the details for each opportunity into its own screen, away from the main sales list. In addition I
              re-architected the content to provide a hierarchy based on what was most important to the user. The goal was to
              make the information scannable so sales agents could make quick decisions.

          <h3 class="page-details-title">Prototyping</h3>
          <div class="page-details-desc">
            <p>The initial design was done in UXPin, but there’s only so much you can show with a static mockup. We needed to
              prototype the interface in code to show stakeholders and customers how it would really work. I had hired an
              intern to code the Sales Center prototype. He was able to implement a multitude of features like drag and drop
              and lazy loading.

          <h3 class="page-details-title">Results</h3>
          <div class="page-details-desc">
            <p>The redesigned Sales Center prototype received rave reviews from both stakeholders and agents who were given a
              demo of the product. The updated interface reversed the sales decline and resulted in additional sales of the
              product.
