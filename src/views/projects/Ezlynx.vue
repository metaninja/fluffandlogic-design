          This section is still a work in progress. But, if you&rsquo;re wondering if I can take the most complex enterprise
          workflows and turn them into streamlined, intuitive, interfaces (in this case personal and commercial
          workflows for independent insurance agents), the answer is yes. Yes, I can.
          For more details on this project, including workflows and how many hundreds of mockups, conversations with
          developers, product managers, product owners, and executives I had to have to get to this point,

        At EZLynx, I have two roles:

        <h2>
          Individual Contributor (IC)
        </h2>

        <p>
          The first is as an individual contributor on any project that has a user interface. In that role, I work with
          the Product teams and Developers following a designing thinking approach from concept to execution.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Kick Off</h3>
        <p>
            Every product at EZLynx starts either at the executive level or with a product manager.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once a product manager has a high level scope, I meet with them to understand their end goals or outcomes of
            the project and learn what they already know e.g. pain points, users, feedback on existing products,
            competitiors, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: Discovery</h3>
        <p>
            After this, I collaborate with the business analyst for the project to setup some user interviews, so we can
            understand the mental models and pain points as they exist today. I’ll then flesh out the user flows,
            personas, context scenarios, information architecture, functional hierarchy.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Ideation</h3>
        <p>
            The next step is ideation. This is the fun part and can take the longest. At this point, I’ll start mocking
            screens in UXPin using reusable components from the EZLynx design systems (more about that later). I’ll
            usually go through multiple iterations of my mockups. After each iteration, I’ll review the mockups with the
            product manager, BA, and front-end engineer for the team assigned to the project and refine the mockups
            based on whether it’s feasible.
        </p>

        <img src="/img/projects/ezlynx/ezlynx-policies.png" class="screenshot" alt="">

        <h3>Step 4: Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            Once the business has signed off on the mockups, we’ll review them further with the engineering team to
            validate and surface any engineering concerns. Once engineering has approved the designs, I’ll continue
            working with them through the development phase, giving my feedback during sprint reviews, or further
            iterating on the mockups if the engineers run into any issues that require changes to the mockups.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Leader</h2>

        <p>
          My other role is that of a design leader for the EZLynx organization. In this role, I work closely with the
          Product, Engineering, and Marketing teams to maintain the design and branding guidelines that the various
          teams use to build their deliverables.

            <h3>
              Product
            </h3>

            <p>
              When I joined EZLynx there hadn’t been a UX person in the company in 2 years. The company had no design
              culture. Consistency and discoverability were huge problems. I had joined EZLynx with the hope of building a
              UX team and doing more user research and usability testing. However, before I could do that, I had to
              establish rapport with the various teams; I had to build trust with Product and Engineering and convince them
              that I was their partner in solving the challenges they were running into and I wasn’t just there to draw
              pretty pictures.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started by applying the UX process to my organization. I interviewed stakeholders in the Product and
              Development team, including BAs, project managers, developers, and more. I then did an audit of the existing
              application and built an inventory of all existing controls, sitemap of the entire app, and the existing user
              flow. I then built a roadmap that would help me build a foundation from which I could then establish a design
              centered culture.

            <h3>
              Product Team
            </h3>

            <p>I started by consolidating the product team on one design tool UXPin, creating shared libraries and reusable
              components that the team could use to build a consistent experience, and trained existing and new members of
              the Product team on how to ensure their designs were up to my standards.
            </p>

            <p>
              I hired, managed, and mentored a small team of UI engineers and UX designers to help manage the increasing
              workload of projects. In my first year at EZLynx, I was easily managing anywhere from 5-7 projects in any
              given week. Today, with a UX team of three, each of us manages between 3-5 projects each. In addition to
              managing the UX team, I also act as the UX project manager, and help to manage the UX team’s project schedule.
            </p>

            <p>
              The product team lacked easy access to user analytics. They had to depend on IT or engineering to build custom
              on-demand reports, and those reports were only available to the individual product manager. I wrote a business
              case, evangelized for and helped roll out FullStory as a user analytics platform that would allow anyone in
              the Product team to easily view user analytics and understand how their products were doing.

            <h3>
              Engineering
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the problems with Engineering was that there were almost a dozen development teams scattered between
              two offices in Dallas and Bangalore. There was only one front-end engineer in the Dallas office. Consistency
              was a major problem. Developers would build new features and components even if there were existing components
              that did the job, and each new component had a different look and feel and behavior from the ones that were
              developed previously. As an example there were 6 different components to upload files into the system, when
              one would have sufficed.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built a design system for the engineering team and acted as an advocate for the front-end engineer to any
              other team I worked with. I pushed for reusing existing components and API-driven approach, instead of
              duplicating functionality.

              The existing brand had become stale by the time I had joined EZLynx and was no longer adequate to handle the
              new products that were being developed. I worked with the marketing team to completely overhaul their brand
              guidelines and built a new one that was designed to be more scalable and work better with the product.
