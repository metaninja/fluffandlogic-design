              Features had been layered organically over the years without much thought to the user experience or
              performance. Performance had slowed to a crawl. Users had time to hit search, go make a fresh batch of
              coffee, and take their time coming back, and would find the search hadn&rsquo;t finished yet.

              The user interface was extremely complicated and confusing. The company brand had become stale and

              When I joined the project, the UX  team had been struggling to keep pace with the developers. They had been
              using traditional design tools like Axure, but the developers needed more direct guidance. The team had
              resorted to designing in code using a pair of now defunct online editors. But the code was only barely
              usable and the team continued to fall behind.

            <p class="section-desc">
              I set aside a couple of days to develop my own tool. The result of that spike was a tool I named BFF, a
              tongue-in-cheek acronym that stood for Barebones Functional Framework. With BFF, we finally caught up to the
              development team and pushed ahead until we had at least several weeks of backlog for the developers to
              choose from.

              In addition to building the BFF prototyping tool, I took on others roles over the next year and a half (see

              The number of teams working on the project grew from one small team with a handful of developers, to four
              teams: two based out of the Securus office, one based out of Chicago, and another based out of Montreal,
              with a total of over 30 developers.

              To maintain consistency in the design, and reduce developer frustration, I helped build a design system that
              was eventually maintained by a dedicated team of designers and developers.
