            Onyx handled commission payments to event managers from hotels where the event had been held. A few months
            before the Pioneer project was started, Onyx had done some focus group research and realized they needed to
            expand beyond the commissions space if they wanted to grow.

          <h3 class="page-details-title">Discovery</h3>
          <section class="page-details-desc">
            <p>
              Working with Onyx, we set up user interviews with hotel event managers who were traditionally the people that
              Onyx dealt with. Through the user interviews we learnt that the event management process was far more complex,
              involving multiple parties and disparate systems, all of which had to interact with one another at various
              stages of the event. However, there was no single system that connected all of these into one smooth workflow.

              In addition to personas and user flows, I created a journey map showing the various parties involved in the
              event management process and the pain points that they went through. The journey map was important in helping
              Onyx get a birds-eye-view of the problem and understand where they would be able to add value.

            <p>
              To show Onyx what a possible solution could look like, I created a prototype in code using my BFF prototyping
              engine. In addition to the prototype, I worked with the solution owner, client manager, and my manager to
              create a slick presentation that would help our product owner pitch the solution to the Onyx executive team
              and board of directors.

            <p>
              Before my contract for the project ended, I pitched the idea of a lean startup style prototype to help take
              the ideation we had done to the next step. Slalom was able to use the prototype and the BRD to pitch a lean
              startup development team to join the project and continue what we had started.
