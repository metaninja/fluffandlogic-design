          <p class="page-abstract-desc">
              In the hotel industry there's a lot of backdoor exchanges that happen for hotels to encourage event
              organizers and wedding planners to have an event at their facility.
          </p>

          <p class="page-abstract-desc">
              One of the tools that hotels use
              to build this relationship with event managers and event planners is to pay a percentage of the sales
              from the hotel hosting the event back to the event organizers. Keeping track of those payments and
              making sure the payments are made can be complicated.
          </p>
          <p class="page-abstract-desc">
            This is where Onyx came in.

        <section class="page-details-desc">
          <p>
            Onyx handled the commissions process and the payment back and forth between hotel chains and event
            managers, freeing up the hotels and event managers to do what they do best: ensure the guests are
            having the best experience they can have.
          </p>

          <p>
            Late in 2015, Onyx realized that if they wanted to grow at all, they were going to have to expand beyond
            the commissions processing market. Slalom was brought in to help them understand the opportunities and
            develop a strategy to expand beyond commissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was my first project at Slalom as the lead UX designer on the project. I was apprehensive when I
            joined the project, even knowing that I could always turn to my UX colleagues and my manager for help if
            I needed to. There was a lot that I didn't know yet about kicking off and managing a UX project.
          </p>

          <p>On top of that, we only had six weeks to complete the entire discovery process, an extremely short time
            for a completely new industry and a green field project.</p>

            <p>
              How do you squeeze a <strong>complete UX discovery workflow</strong> into <strong>six weeks</strong>
              with one UX designer? The key was to start with the outcome in mind. Once we knew what we had to
              deliver at the end, we made a list of what artifacts we would need to get to the outcome, and walked
              back week by week to figure out which activities needed to be completed at the end of each week.

              Once I had completed the user interviews and analysed the pain points, I started to build the personas
              and existing user flows.

              When I analyzed the workflows and the personas I had built from the user interviews, I realized that
              there was a lot of overlap between the various personas involved in the event management workflow.
            </p>

            <p>
              I needed a visual representation of the pain points that users ran into at various points in the event
              workflow. A journey map ended up being the most practical way to show all that information in an
              easy-to-digest, scannable way (although based on my UX manager's advice, I should split each user's
              journey into a separate journey map):

              To show Onyx what a possible solution could look like, I created a prototype in code using the
              <a href="http://bff.how/" target="_blank"><strong>BFF prototyping engine</strong></a>, a prototyping
              tool that I had developed to help my UX team ideate much faster than was traditionally possible (see

              information).</p>

          <div class="page-details-desc">
            <p>
              The journey map, coded prototype, and BRD were hugely influential in helping the Onyx executive team
              consider expanding their business beyond the commissions market and into the much larger event
              management industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey map helped the executives see at a glance where their customers greatest pain points were, but
              also where their biggest challenges would be and where they should concentrate their limited capital.
              Since Onyx was a fairly conservative organization with a small development team, the journey map would
              help them navigate the uncertain waters ahead of them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Meanwhile, the prototype helped Onyx visualize what a solution could look like. The prototype was
              responsive out of the box (i.e. it worked on everything from mobile devices with small screens to
              desktop environments with plenty of real estate). The product owner was blown away when I presented the
              Onyx prototype on my phone one afternoon as we were returning from lunch.
            </p>

            <p>
              As we were wrapping up the project, I worked with my team members to pitch the idea of a lean
              startup-style project using the prototype as a starting point to help jump-start Onyx's push into the
              event management business.
            </p>

            <p>
              It took several months for the Onyx executive team to make a decision, but in the end they gave Slalom
              the go ahead to start a lean-startup style project to build an app using the lessons we had learnt from
              the discovery project above. By then I had left Slalom, but I am confident that the journey map
              and prototype helped Slalom secure this additional contract from Onyx and gave the new Slalom team a
              step up in the development process.
